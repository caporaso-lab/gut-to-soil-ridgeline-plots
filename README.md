## Using `analysis.py`
This script takes a metadata file and a distance matrix, and outputs per-bucket json files that contain per-comparison distances. To use:

```
python analysis.py <output-directory>
```

The locations of the metadata file and distance matrix are specified within the script. See the `calculate_distances` function in `analysis.py` for detailed descriptions of the available parameters.


## Generating the figures
In `src/lib/Container.svelte` change the `beginDir` and `endDir` variables to point to the locations of the output files generated by `analysis.py`.

Now, navigate to the `distances-figs` directory. Next, run `npm install`, then run `npm run dev`. Now navigate to the url indicated in the terminal to view the figures. Individual plots or the entire faceted plot can be downloaded by using the buttons at the bottom of the page.
