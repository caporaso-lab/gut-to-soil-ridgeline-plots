Distributions of unweighted unifrac distances for all buckets separated by
type of comparison within each bucket. The last n=3 timepoints of post-roll
samples were used. Missing ids (in the metadata but not the matrix) were 
ignored. Figures have different x axis ranges so be careful comparing
absolutely across buckets.
